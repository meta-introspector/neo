# Layer 6: Construction and Relationship

Layer 6 represents the active construction of complex entities through the combination of simpler elements, emphasizing the relationships that bind them. It signifies the practical application of foundational principles to build meaningful structures.

-   **Conceptual State:** Combination, synthesis, relationship, practical application.
-   **Connection to ZOS:** Conceptually linked to the number 6 (2*3), illustrating the fundamental theory of memes where composite meanings are constructed from the intrinsic meanings of their prime factors (2 and 3). It highlights the interplay between duality and trinity.
-   **Role in Neo:** Provides the conceptual basis for how complex memes are formed from simpler ones, how predicates combine to define meme addresses, and how various conceptual elements interrelate to form a cohesive system.
