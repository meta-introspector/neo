# Boolean Predicates and Hierarchical Structure in Neo

To formally describe the multifaceted nature of the Neo project, a set of boolean predicates has been constructed, representing key ideas and properties. These predicates are organized into a hierarchical structure through successive binary divisions, allowing for a systematic and granular understanding of the project's conceptual landscape.

## Hierarchical Split of Predicates

The predicates are split in a meaningful way, reflecting the core aspects of the Neo project. The top-level division separates fundamental system properties from the foundational concepts and influences that shape the project.

### Level 1: Core Divisions

-   **Core System Properties:** Predicates describing the fundamental nature and capabilities of the Neo system.
-   **Foundational Concepts & Influences:** Predicates describing the underlying theories, philosophies, and mathematical tools that inform the Neo project.

### Level 2: Sub-Divisions

**Under Core System Properties:**

-   **Evolution & Agency:** Focuses on the dynamic, self-modifying, and agentic aspects of the system.
-   **Meaning & Interaction:** Addresses how meaning is generated, interpreted, and how elements within the system interact.

**Under Foundational Concepts & Influences:**

-   **Mathematical & Logical Basis:** Encompasses the mathematical and logical underpinnings of the project.
-   **Theoretical & Analogical Frameworks:** Includes the broader theoretical models and illustrative analogies that influence Neo.

### Level 3: Specific Predicates

Each of these Level 2 categories is further subdivided into specific boolean predicates, each representing a distinct idea or property of the Neo project. These predicates are documented in the `neo_predicates.ttl` RDF ontology file, where their hierarchical relationships are formally defined using `rdfs:subPropertyOf`.

## Connection to ZOS: Bits and Powers

This set of boolean predicates forms a foundational layer for the Neo project's self-description and introspection. The total number of distinct predicates defined is **24**.

Let `n` represent this number of predicates, so `n = 24`.

As per the project's conceptual framework, this "set of bits" (representing the truth value of each predicate) is seen in relation to the Zero Ontology System (ZOS).

-   The number of predicates, `n`, is used in a conceptual connection to the "first part of ZOS" (which is the prime number 2). The relationship is expressed as `n^2`, which in this case is `24^2 = 576`.
-   Furthermore, the concept extends to raising `n` to the power of the full ZOS value. Given ZOS = 9,699,690, this implies a vast conceptual space: `n^ZOS` (i.e., `24^9,699,690`). This represents the immense combinatorial possibilities and the depth of the conceptual landscape that can be explored and generated within the Neo ecosystem, where each predicate contributes to the overall complexity and richness of the system's self-awareness.
