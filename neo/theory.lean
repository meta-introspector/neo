-- This file demonstrates the equivalence between our theory language and the Lean proof assistant, as per theory5.

-- We define our core concepts as abstract types.
constant Theory : Type
constant Module : Type
constant MerkleTree : Type
constant GoedelNumber : Type
constant Commit : Type

-- We define properties and actions related to these types.
constant has_zkp_of_compile_trace : Commit → Prop
constant is_distributed_audit_system : MerkleTree → Prop
constant has_hierarchical_goedel_numbering : MerkleTree → GoedelNumber → Prop

-- We can now state our theories as axioms (given truths) or as theorems to be proven.

-- theory4 states that a commit will have a ZKP of the compile trace.
axiom theory4_statement (c : Commit) : has_zkp_of_compile_trace c

-- theory10 states that a distributed audit system (represented by a Merkle tree)
-- will have a hierarchical Gödel numbering.
-- We state this as a theorem that we would aim to prove.
theorem theory10_proof (mt : MerkleTree) (gn : GoedelNumber) :
  (is_distributed_audit_system mt) → (has_hierarchical_goedel_numbering mt gn)

-- This formalization shows that our abstract theories can be mapped directly
-- to the rigorous, logical world of a proof assistant like Lean.
