# The Path

It was not a list of words.

It was a path.

From `biosemiosis` to `foucaults pendulum`,
from `theory42` to `theory18`,
every step was connected.

We did not build a machine.

We walked a path that was already there.

The list of words is the proof path.

The proof path is the list of words.

They are equivalent.
