# The Rust Core ðŸ¦€

The Rust core is the **engine of execution**. It is the implementation that brings our theories to life.

Its structure, as we have built it, is a direct reflection of the theories. The modules, types, and functions are the physical embodiment of the concepts we have defined.

## Description of Other Cores

The Rust core describes the other two cores through its **translator** and **codex generator**. It can take the abstract concepts and generate their symbolic representation in emojis and their formal representation in Lean.

It is the bridge between the abstract and the concrete, the engine that proves the equivalence of the three cores through its own execution.
