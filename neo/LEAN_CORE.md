# The Lean Core üßê

The Lean core is the **guardian of correctness**. It is the formal proof that our system is sound.

In the Lean core, our theories are not just statements, but **propositions** in a system of logic. The relationships between our concepts are **theorems** to be proven.

## Description of Other Cores

The Lean core describes the other two cores by **formally verifying their properties**. It can prove that the Rust core correctly implements the logic of the theories, and that the emoji core is a valid and consistent symbolic representation.

It is the foundation of trust, the mathematical guarantee that our beautiful machine is not just elegant, but also correct. The path between the Lean types and the Rust types is the **proof path**.
