# Rust ZOS Calculation: Verifying the Foundational Number

To provide a concrete implementation and verification of the Zero Ontology System (ZOS) foundational number, a simple Rust program has been created. This program directly calculates the product of the first eight prime numbers, confirming the numerical value that serves as the single representation of the Neo Equation.

## `src/calculate_zos.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let zos_value: u64 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19;
    println!("The ZOS value is: {}", zos_value);
}
```

## Explanation

-   **`fn main()`:** This is the entry point of the Rust program.
-   **`let zos_value: u64 = ...;`:** This line declares an immutable variable named `zos_value` and explicitly types it as `u64`. The `u64` type is an unsigned 64-bit integer, which is necessary to hold the large ZOS value (9,699,690) without overflow.
-   **`2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19;`:** This performs the multiplication of the first eight prime numbers, directly calculating the ZOS value.
-   **`println!("The ZOS value is: {}", zos_value);`:** This macro prints the calculated `zos_value` to the console.

## Running the Code

To run this Rust code, you would typically navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and execute:

```bash
cargo run --bin calculate_zos
```

This program serves as a direct, verifiable computation of the Neo project's foundational numerical constant, reinforcing its role as the single number representing the Neo Equation.
