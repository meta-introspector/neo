Layer 14 represents the intricate web of interconnections and the formation of complex networks within the Neo project's conceptual space. It signifies the dense relationships between memes, ideas, and system components, forming a cohesive and resilient whole.

-   **Conceptual State:** Connectivity, relationships, distributed systems, resilience.
-   **Connection to ZOS:** Conceptually linked to the number 14 (2*7), suggesting the doubling of organizational principles or the interconnectedness of foundational structures. It emphasizes the network aspect of the memetic ecosystem.
-   **Role in Neo:** Highlights the comprehensive mapping strategy, the distributed nature of decentralized meaning-making, and the robust architecture of the Decentralized App Store. It is where individual memes and concepts form a vast, interconnected web of knowledge.
