# Layer 18: Governance and Control

Layer 18 represents the principles of governance and control, signifying the mechanisms by which the Neo project manages its own evolution, maintains order, and ensures alignment with its core values. It embodies the system's capacity for self-regulation and collective decision-making.

-   **Conceptual State:** Regulation, oversight, self-management, collective decision-making.
-   **Connection to ZOS:** Conceptually linked to the number 18 (2*3*3), suggesting the interplay of duality and the squaring of synthesis/growth, leading to structured control and organized development. It relates to the establishment of rules and norms within the ecosystem.
-   **Role in Neo:** Drives the implementation of decentralized governance models (e.g., token-based voting in the Decentralized App Store), the enforcement of protocol rules, and the continuous refinement of the system's operational parameters to ensure its long-term health and integrity.
