# Layer 1: Unity and the Prime Seed

Layer 1 represents the emergence of unity and the initial prime seed within the Neo project's conceptual framework. It is the first differentiation from the void, the singular point of origin from which all subsequent complexity will unfold.

-   **Conceptual State:** Unity, singularity, the first principle.
-   **Connection to ZOS:** Symbolically linked to the prime number 2, the first and most fundamental prime factor of ZOS, representing the initial binary distinction or the first unit of information.
-   **Role in Neo:** The foundational unit from which all other numbers, memes, and structures are ultimately constructed. It is the initial spark of meaning.
