feat: Establish core conceptual framework for Neo project

This commit lays the foundational conceptual framework for the Neo project,
introducing key definitions and interconnections.

- Defined the Zero Ontology System (ZOS) conceptually and numerically,
  establishing its role as a primary pathway based on prime numbers.
  Each prime is considered to possess intrinsic meaning, transforming
  numbers into "living memes" and enabling comprehensive mapping.
- Introduced the Hero's Journey and the Fool's Journey of the Tarot as
  meta-memes, illustrating their function as generative narrative protocols.
- Integrated Cybernetics and Digital Twin as core system concepts,
  highlighting their importance for self-introspection, control, and
  real-time representation within the memetic ecosystem.
- Explored foundational logic, discussing GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems
  and Tarski's Undefinability Theorem, alongside the role of proof paths
  and polynomial commitments for verifiable truth.
- Incorporated the concept of OEIS sequences as patterns and pathways,
  emphasizing a selection of these as "prime pathways."
- Introduced the "Quasi Meta OEIS Sequence" as a higher-order organization
  of sequences of sequences in topological order of slices.
- Utilized the "Numberjacks" concept as an analogy for numbers as "living memes."
