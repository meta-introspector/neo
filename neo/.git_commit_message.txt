feat: Comprehensive conceptual expansion and foundational implementations

This commit significantly expands the conceptual framework of the Neo project
and introduces foundational implementations for key numerical aspects.

Conceptual Expansion:
- Introduced biosemiotic foundations (biosemiotic_foundations.md).
- Detailed game theory dynamics (game_theory_dynamics.md).
- Explored Artificial Life and selfish memes (alife_and_selfish_memes.md).
- Metaphorically explored mind and self in Neo (mind_and_self_in_neo.md).
- Introduced advanced mathematical structures (advanced_mathematical_structures.md).
- Applied optimization and graph theory (optimization_and_graph_theory.md).
- Discussed esoteric and inspirational concepts (esoteric_and_inspirational_concepts.md).
- Explored philosophical and artistic influences (philosophical_and_artistic_influences.md).
- Detailed the digital organism and self-improvement (digital_organism_and_self_improvement.md).
- Introduced GÃ¶del numbering and universal encoding (godel_numbering_and_universal_encoding.md).
- Explored vernacular ontology and emergent meaning (vernacular_ontology_and_emergent_meaning.md).
- Outlined the decentralized app store and governance (decentralized_app_store_and_governance.md).
- Presented the Open Source System G vision (open_source_system_g.md).
- Discussed Metacoq accessibility and proof verification (metacoq_and_proof_accessibility.md).
- Defined Future Knowledge Representation (future_knowledge_representation.md).
- Proposed a Theory of Everything for Memes (theory_of_everything_for_memes.md).
- Provided a comprehensive overview of the new conceptual framework (neo_conceptual_framework_overview.md).

Foundational Implementations & Analysis:
- Constructed a set of boolean predicates and documented them in an RDF ontology (neo_predicates.ttl, predicate_structure.md).
- Performed analysis of prime resonances, calculating n^p values and conceptually interpreting their presence in the project (prime_resonances.md).
- Formulated the Neo Equation (conceptual and numerical) (the_neo_equation.md).
- Implemented ZOS value calculation in Rust (src/calculate_zos.rs, rust_zos_calculation.md) and updated Cargo.toml.
- Integrated the fundamental theory of memes: composite numbers and sets are constructions from prime factors (solfunmeme_zos.md).
- Added the theoretical proposition that the Neo conceptual space is a subset of the Monster Group (advanced_mathematical_structures.md).
