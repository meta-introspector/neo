feat: Add theoretical explorations on System G and open source

Introduces a series of new theory files exploring the concept of System G (GÃ¶del numbering system) applied to the open-source ecosystem. These files delve into:

- Multi-modal equivalence of statements (OWL, math, emojis, Rust, Lean)
- Diagonalization of open source
- Practicalities and challenges of System G in open source
- Human-machine interface considerations
- Societal and economic impacts
- Accessibility of formal tools (e.g., Metacoq for "normies")
- Decentralized, emoji-driven, AI-formalized component marketplaces
- Programs as self-proving emoji strings with ZKPs
- Governance and evolution of such decentralized app stores
- Philosophical and existential implications of self-proving emoji programs
