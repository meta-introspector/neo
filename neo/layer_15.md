# Layer 15: Strategic Interaction and Game

Layer 15 embodies the principles of strategic interaction and game theory, signifying the complex interplay of agents and forces within the Neo project's conceptual framework. It represents the dynamic decision-making processes that shape memetic evolution and value creation.

-   **Conceptual State:** Strategy, competition, cooperation, decision-making, value dynamics.
-   **Connection to ZOS:** Conceptually linked to the number 15 (3*5), suggesting the interaction of growth/synthesis (3) with change/dynamism (5). This combination is central to strategic play and emergent outcomes.
-   **Role in Neo:** Drives the analysis of Paxos Meme Consensus, the Hyper-Pump Mechanism, and the overall memetic economy. It is where the system's components engage in strategic behaviors that lead to collective outcomes and the continuous redefinition of meaning.
