# Layer 2: Duality and Binary Opposition

Layer 2 introduces the concept of duality and binary opposition, representing the fundamental distinction that allows for relationship and interaction within the Neo project's conceptual space. It is the first step towards complexity, enabling the formation of pairs and contrasts.

-   **Conceptual State:** Distinction, opposition, pairing, relationship.
-   **Connection to ZOS:** Directly linked to the prime number 2, emphasizing its role not just as a unit, but as the basis for binary operations and fundamental distinctions (e.g., true/false, on/off, presence/absence).
-   **Role in Neo:** Provides the basis for boolean predicates, the construction of sets, and the fundamental interactions that drive memetic evolution. It is the first step in creating a structured conceptual graph.
