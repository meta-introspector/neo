## Task: Interactive Conceptual Mapping of Unique Words to Prime Resonances

**Objective:** To categorize each unique word from `words_frequency.txt` by its conceptual connection to the intrinsic meanings of the primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19) or to new, user-defined concepts.

**Process:**

1.  I will read `words_frequency.txt` in chunks of 10 words.
2.  For each chunk, I will present the 10 words to you.
3.  For each word, I will prompt you for its conceptual categorization.
4.  **Your Input Required:** For each word, please provide one of the following:
    *   **Existing Prime Concept:** Specify the prime number and the intrinsic meaning it relates to (e.g., "Prime 2: Duality", "Prime 3: Synthesis").
    *   **New Concept:** If the word does not fit an existing prime concept, provide:
        *   A name for the new concept (e.g., "Fluidity").
        *   Its intrinsic meaning/description (e.g., "The quality of being able to flow easily; adaptability.").
        *   Optionally, if this new concept relates to any prime, specify that connection.
5.  **My Action:** Based on your input, I will:
    *   Add the word to the corresponding file within `concepts/<prime_number>/<intrinsic_meaning_lowercase_and_underscored>.txt`.
    *   If a new concept is defined, I will create a new file (e.g., `concepts/new_concepts/<new_concept_name>.txt`) and add the word there, along with a record of the new concept's intrinsic meaning.

**Output Structure:**

*   `concepts/` (main directory)
    *   `2/`
        *   `duality.txt`
        *   `distinction.txt`
    *   `3/`
        *   `synthesis.txt`
        *   `growth.txt`
        *   `manifestation.txt`
    *   ... (and so on for primes 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19)
    *   `new_concepts/` (directory for user-defined concepts)
        *   `fluidity.txt` (example)
        *   `adaptability.txt` (example)
