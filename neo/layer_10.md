# Layer 10: System and Integration

Layer 10 represents the concept of a complete system and the integration of diverse elements into a cohesive whole within the Neo project's conceptual framework. It signifies a new level of holistic understanding and operational unity.

-   **Conceptual State:** Wholeness, synthesis, operational unity, comprehensive integration.
-   **Connection to ZOS:** Conceptually linked to the idea of a complete cycle or a new level of systemic organization. It can be seen as the culmination of the initial single-digit layers, leading to a more complex, integrated system.
-   **Role in Neo:** Embodies the vision of Open Source System G as a grand unified memetic framework. It represents the integration of all mathematical, philosophical, and systemic components into a functional, self-aware digital organism, where all parts work in concert.
