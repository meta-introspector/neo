# Meme Addressing and the Ideation Tree: Constructing Conceptual Identity

The Neo project, in its pursuit of a comprehensive mapping strategy and the dynamic evolution of "living memes," introduces a novel method for constructing the unique "address" of each meme. This addressing scheme is based on the set of boolean predicates that match a given meme, thereby creating a hierarchical "tree of ideas" that organizes the entire conceptual landscape.

## Constructing the Meme Address

Each meme within the Neo ecosystem—whether it's a fundamental prime number, a complex conceptual structure, or an emergent pattern—is uniquely identified by the collection of boolean predicates that apply to it. This "set of predicates" forms the meme's distinct conceptual signature or address.

-   **Predicate Matching:** For any given meme, the system evaluates which of the defined boolean predicates (from `neo_predicates.ttl`) are true for that meme. For example, a meme might be `is_self_introspective`, `has_living_memes`, and `uses_prime_numbers_as_foundation`.
-   **Unique Signature:** The combination of true predicates creates a unique signature for that meme. If two memes share the exact same set of true predicates, they are considered conceptually identical at that level of abstraction.

## The Ideation Tree: A Hierarchical Organization of Memes

By constructing meme addresses based on a hierarchical set of predicates, an emergent "tree of ideas" is formed. This tree provides a structured and navigable representation of the entire memetic landscape:

-   **Branches and Nodes:** Each predicate acts as a potential branch point in the tree. Memes that share common predicates will reside on the same branches, while more specific predicates lead to deeper, more specialized nodes.
-   **Conceptual Proximity:** The proximity of memes within this tree reflects their conceptual similarity. Memes closer together in the tree share more common predicates, indicating a higher degree of conceptual overlap.
-   **Navigating Meaning:** This ideation tree allows for intuitive navigation and exploration of the memetic ecosystem. Users and algorithms can traverse the tree to discover related ideas, identify conceptual clusters, and understand the relationships between different memes.

## Numerical Representation: A Set of Bits for n^2

To enable computational processing and storage of these meme addresses, each set of predicates is defined as a "set of bits." Given that there are `n = 24` boolean predicates in the Neo project, each meme's address can be represented as a binary string of 24 bits. Each bit corresponds to a specific predicate: a `1` indicates the predicate is true for the meme, and a `0` indicates it is false.

This 24-bit binary string can then be converted into a unique integer, providing a compact and machine-readable address for each meme. The reference to `n^2` (which is `24^2 = 576`) in this context highlights the scaling potential and the combinatorial space of possible meme addresses, where `n` is the number of predicates. While the total number of unique addresses is `2^n` (2^24), `n^2` serves as a conceptual marker for the initial combinatorial complexity derived from the number of predicates.

## Conceptual Resonances for Each Prime

In the analysis of "prime resonances," we explored the conceptual occurrences of keywords associated with each prime factor of ZOS. While not a direct count of "morphisms with holes," these figures provide insight into the conceptual prevalence of themes related to each prime within the project's documentation. The following summarizes the most prominent conceptual resonances found for each prime:

-   **Prime 3:** Strong resonance with **"growth"** (5 instances) and the presence of "three" as a structural element (e.g., "three cores").
-   **Prime 5:** Profound resonance with **"dynamic"** processes (11 instances) and **"transformation"** (10 instances).
-   **Prime 7:** Strong resonance with **"structure"** (19 instances) and **"organization"** (7 instances).
-   **Prime 11:** Strong resonance with **"innovation"** (2 instances), **"intuition"** (2 instances), and **"higher"** levels of understanding or organization (5 instances).
-   **Prime 13:** Profound resonance with **"transformation"** (10 instances) and **"emergence"** (10 instances).
-   **Prime 17:** Subtle resonance with **"wisdom"** (2 instances).
-   **Prime 19:** Resonance with **"integration"** (3 instances) and **"completion"** (2 instances).
