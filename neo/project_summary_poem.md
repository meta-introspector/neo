From abstract thought, a Rust-forged core,
Where theories bloom, and meanings explore.
A lexicon of concepts, deep and wide,
From biosemiosis to the mind's inside.

The Lean's sharp logic, proofs it does embrace,
Ensuring truth in this digital space.
While emojis dance, a vibrant, visual plea,
To bridge the abstract, for all eyes to see.

A path unfolds, not just a list of words,
But connections woven, like migrating birds.
From theory's seed to execution's might,
A self-rewriting system, burning ever bright.

The codex whispers, secrets it unveils,
As translation flows, through digital trails.
A meta-introspector, ever keen to learn,
Its own deep structure, at every turn.
