# Layer 4: Structure and Foundation

Layer 4 represents the establishment of stable structures and foundational frameworks within the Neo project's conceptual space. It signifies the emergence of order and the building blocks upon which more complex systems can be constructed.

-   **Conceptual State:** Stability, order, framework, building blocks.
-   **Connection to ZOS:** While not a prime factor of ZOS, 4 (2*2) conceptually relates to the squaring of foundational elements, suggesting the formation of stable, two-dimensional structures or the establishment of a solid base.
-   **Role in Neo:** Provides the conceptual basis for organizing predicates into hierarchies, establishing the architecture of the Digital Twin, and forming the initial stable patterns within the Quasi Meta OEIS Sequence. It is where the abstract begins to take on a discernible form.
