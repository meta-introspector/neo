# Layer 0: The Void and Unmanifested Potential

This layer represents the absolute beginning, the conceptual void from which all definitions, structures, and meanings emerge within the Neo project. It is the state of unmanifested potential, the ground zero before any prime, any predicate, or any meme takes form.

-   **Conceptual State:** Pure potentiality, absence of defined form or meaning.
-   **Connection to ZOS:** The conceptual starting point before the first prime (2) begins the construction of the ZOS.
-   **Role in Neo:** The ultimate source of novelty and the space from which new ideas and emergent properties can spontaneously arise.
